		<h1>Hello I'm Leah Tolson,</h1>

		<p>I am working towards becoming a skilled website and application developer. My main drive for pursuing this career is my interest in the IoT and encountering many websites/apps with subpar features and thinking, "If I could just learn how this works, I could try and make it better!"</p>
		
		<p>My first introdcution to coding and web development was a one semester course I took in highschool where we developed a very basic website with information about ourselves and our interests. Since then I've been eager to learn more which is why I enrolled in the online Web and Mobile App Development certificate program at DeVry University. Here I have learned alot about coding, programming, development, and design. Though I am looking forward to the opportunity to gain more knowlege in a real work environment.</p>
		
		<p>Outside of my eductional pursuits I enjoy just about any hobby that allows me to be creative. Creating traditonal and digital art has been a favorite passtime for almost my whole life. Crocheting and sewing is another way in which I like to express my creativity as it's always fulfilling to be able to wear/use what you've taken the time to make.</p>
