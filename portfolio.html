			<dt>IoT Security Prototype</dt>
			<dd>- I built a home automation and security system prototype that included a door sensor, distance sensor, and automated lights. To program this prototype I used the Arduino IDE software and the Arduino Mega Board 2560.</dd>
			
			<dt>Programming with Data</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I utilized a cloud-based system to gather temperature and humidity data based on my zip code, I then analyzed the data through programming in Python IDE(Spyder) and data analytics through Excel.</dd>
			
			<dt>Fundamentals of Linux</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I accessed Linux through the cloud via an Azure Lab Services virtual machine and performed a wide variety of administrative tasks including navigating the Linux filesystem, writing shell scripts, and monitoring system performance.</dd>
			
			<dt>Stock Tracking Program</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I created a GUI using object-oriented techniques in Python that tracks stocks. I also downloaded and processed historical data to generate profit/loss reports and charts showing stock trends. </dd>
			
			<dt>Payroll System GUI</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I created a GUI using object-oriented techniques in C# that keeps track of basic employee information and will print out paychecks for each employee every two weeks.</dd>
			
			<dt>SQL Database</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I designed and created a database using SQL for a hypothetical company so that the managers of said company can keep track of their customers, employees, projects, project schedules, assignments, and invoices.</dd>
			
			<dt>Landscaping Business GUI</dt>
			<dd>- In this project I designed a GUI using a Wireframe and Class diagrams made in Microsoft Visio. I then created a business application that could take input from the user, make calculations, and save info to a MySQL database.</dd>

		<dt>Small Business Directory Web/Mobile App</dt>
		<dd>- I would like to create either a website or mobile app that will allow users to discover new small businesses by using a keyword search function. It will also allow users to view a businesses profile to see which platforms they sell from and/or if they take commissions.</dd>
